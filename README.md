## Project Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Unit Testing** and **Integration Testing** using **PyTest** in Python.

A simple **Banking Application** is developed containing basic banking operations such as:
- Deposit
- Withdraw
- Interest Calculation
- Loan Eligibility Check
- Money Transfer

Unit tests are written to test each function independently, while integration tests are written to verify the interaction between multiple functions.  
The project also uses **GitHub Actions** to automate test execution using Continuous Integration (CI).
